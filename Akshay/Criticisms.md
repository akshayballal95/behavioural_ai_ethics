1. User Safety and risk-benefit analysis
	- Brain's plasticity is still-developing children and even in adults could bring about unknown negative side-effects of BCI use.
	- A sudden lack of functionality would impact the user directly and immediately. BCI operated wheel chair could fail in the middle of the street while crossing
2. Humanity and Personhood
	- Whether BCI users will become "cyborgs" - an integrated man-machine system
	- But authors argue that we have been routinely using technology to change the body in the form of artificial devices replacing broken parts. (Bone implants, pacemakers)
	- Risk of losing what makes us human. 
	- Evolving into "*Homo Sapiens Technologicus*"
	- May change our social identity, body schema, or individual psychological aspects
3. Stigma and Normality
	- If an individual does not see him or herself as disabled, is a BCI that is meant to be assistive technology actually an enhancement?

Examples of the directionality heuristic outside of BCI are not hard to find. Functional MRI used to identify psychological traits (‘brainotyping’) is an example.[7] As a gleaning neurotechnology, fMRI technology can be seen to raise questions about privacy. What is the nature of the information gathered by means of this technology? Who controls or owns this information? How can it be legitimately used? What counts as a violation or transgression relative to this information?

The question – is it a tool or is it myself? – takes on an ethical valence when researchers ask whether BCI users will become “cyborgs.” [[ethical aspects of brain computer interfaces.pdf]]

Not all authors are convinced that this concern is unique to BCIs, that it is worrying, or that it is even possible. Some emphasize the fact that we already have used technology to tinker with ourselves – specifying examples such as sports equipment and other medical interventions – and thus humans are already intricately linked to their technologies [9]. We incorporate tools into our self-understanding and body schemas [6, 8], and routinely use technology to change the body in
the form of artificial devices replacing broken parts [9].
