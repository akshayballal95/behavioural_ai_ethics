In this section, we will see why we must develop AI technologies that can enable Brain-Computer Interfaces to cater to individuals with disabilities. I argue that, despite some of the criticisms related to loss of personhood and the social stigmas associated with BCI, it is ethically very important to continue developing this technology. We will also dive more into these criticisms and counterarguments and explain why these criticisms should not impede the development of BCI technology. We will also see how we can use the Capability Approach Framework (Amartya Sen) to reinforce our argument.

Accessibility is one of the most important aspects of any design these days. From public infrastructures like museums and offices to digital interfaces like apps and websites, accessibility is at the core of design principles. Catering to people with disabilities has always been a challenge across different fields. Similar to accessibility, inclusivity is equally essential. In a way, inclusivity and accessibility are related. For a system to be inclusive, it must first be accessible to all. Disability inclusion means that individuals with disabilities can participate in every aspect of life to the fullest extent possible. These opportunities include participation in education, employment, public health programs, community living, and service learning. However, it can be seen that even the most accessible and inclusive systems may not be able to integrate people with disabilities to the complete extent possible. People with disabilities can be catered to in two different ways.

1. Changing the surrounding environment to accommodate and compensate for the disability

2. Reducing the extent of their disability so they can interact with the environment like people without disabilities do.

Several design frameworks exist to address the former. These include ramps, text-to-speech, and special schools. But we can argue that even though these solutions make the system more inclusive, there is more to be desired. Given a choice to reduce the disability so that these changes in the environment can be avoided, that would be the best option.

Brain-computer interfaces have the potential to use Artificial intelligence to let people perform actions that they otherwise wouldn't given their disability. There have been several advancements in BCI technologies that have shown promising breakthroughs in thought-to-speech and thought-to-action. This shows that BCI can reduce or, in some cases, completely eliminate the disability of a person.  Thus, it is safe to argue that using Artificial Intelligence to increase the capabilities of Brain-Computer Interfaces leads to higher accessibility and inclusivity for people with disabilities.

Capability Approach is an ethical framework that claims that the freedom to achieve well-being is of primary moral importance, and well-being should be understood in terms of people's capabilities and functioning. _Functionings_ represent parts of the state of a person, in particular, the various things that he or she manages to do or be in leading a life. The _capability_ of a person reflects the alternative combinations of functionings the person can achieve and from which he or she can choose one collection. Some functionings are very elementary, such as being adequately nourished, being in good health, etc., and all may strongly value these for obvious reasons. Others may be more complex but still widely valued, such as achieving self‐respect or being socially integrated. The capability approach framework has three main blocks. Resources, capabilities, and functionings. For example, to be able to drive a car, the resource would be the car itself and the roads. The capability will be a person’s skill to drive a car. The functionings would be the different human characteristics like vision and motor movements of limbs required to execute those capabilities.

Given the capability approach, we can see that BCIs act as "Enablers". They enable the well-being of people with disabilities to get back an extent of their _functionings_ to achieve what they want.

### Stakeholders

Three stakeholders can be identified when using BCI technology to empower people with disabilities. First, are the people using the BCI technology to regain their functionings. Naturally, this is going to be beneficial for them because it allows them to achieve well-being. However, one of the downsides could be the social stigma attached to using technology to perform everyday tasks. People with prosthetics often encounter stares and comments about their synthetic limbs, which might create discomfort. One way to tackle this would be to drive social awareness campaigns to normalize the use of BCI. Also, some people do not identify themselves as disabled. They prefer the term "differently abled" and these people would not want to carry the moral burden of using BCI technology to restore their functionings because they are happy as they are. Thus, we must ensure that people with disabilities who do not use BCI are not viewed as moral offenders because it has to be their choice.

The second group of stakeholders who would be affected by the penetration and improvement of BCI technology are the designers and planners. Generally, designers and planners have to focus a lot of effort on creating systems that are accessible and inclusive for all the people using them. Suppose technology can help reduce the number of people with disabilities so that they can use these systems the same way anyone else would. In that case, the designers and planners can put more effort into improving their designs and plans and less effort into making them accessible.

The third group of stakeholders is the policymakers. Policymakers would be faced with a new challenge of how to control the distribution of BCI technology. As we will see in the next section, uncontrolled distribution of BCI can result in a few privileged classes of people who may use this technology unethically. Also, the technology would have to be made available to everyone in an affordable way so that all people with disabilities have the right to adopt BCI and achieve well-being.

### Criticisms

Some criticisms and counterarguments have been and could be raised against the BCI technologies acting as "Enablers" for people with disabilities.

1. Does this technology make people less human? The term "Cyborgization" comes to mind.

2. Using technology to enable critical functionings and capabilities like crossing a road or driving a vehicle can have unintended consequences if the technology fails.

3. Could result in a privileged class of superhumans.

The first criticism against the technology has been raised a lot, but it has not been clearly shown what cyborgization is and why it would be bad. Humans have always used technology to increase their capabilities and add more functionings. For example, humans alone cannot move at a speed more than roughly 30 km/hr. When a human integrates with an automobile, he/she can quickly reach over 100 km/hr without tiring himself/herself. Similarly, cochlear implants are "enablers" for people who are profoundly deaf and spectacles for people with vision problems. We have also implanted ourselves with pacemakers and bone replacements to restore our critical body functionings. I would argue that cyborgization has been taking place for a long time, and BCIs are a big step towards this. But it cannot be shown that cyborgization is terrible because if cyborgization can act as an "Enabler" in the capability approach, then it is good.

The second criticism is something that can put a halt to the development of BCI technology because a couple of mishaps due to BCI can shed a bad light on this technology. However, this can be viewed as an engineering and risk management problem. BCI technology developers have to ensure enough redundancies and fallbacks in case BCIs are used to restore functionings used for critical capabilities like driving or crossing a road. Risk mitigation is of crucial importance. It is similar to other critical technologies developed before, like airplanes, where a small mishap could lead to a catastrophe. But because we know there is a significant risk, certification bodies and engineers must make the qualification and testing very stringent. Today, because of strict certification and high-quality assurance, aircraft are one of the safest modes of transport.

The third criticism is of the highest concern if we look at BCI as a means to restore or substitute human functionings. If given complete freedom to develop and use BCI technology, some privileged individuals can extend their functionings beyond human levels. For example, using BCI and exoskeletons to achieve superhuman strength or integrate with a knowledge base to achieve superintelligence. It is paramount to control the distribution and development of BCI technology to adhere to the capability approach. This entails restricting the technology's scope to restoring essential functionings for the well-being of individuals diagnosed with disabilities, refraining from augmenting functionings beyond these fundamental requirements for capability restoration.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, developing Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) to empower individuals with disabilities is an ethically imperative endeavor. Critics may raise concerns about the loss of personhood, technological failures, and the potential for creating a privileged class of superhumans. However, these criticisms should not deter us from progressing in this field. BCIs, when approached with the Capability Approach framework, serve as enablers that enhance individuals' well-being by restoring critical functionings. While addressing social stigma concerns and ensuring choice for those who identify as differently-abled, BCIs also relieve designers and planners from the burden of excessive accessibility efforts. Policymakers must navigate the responsible distribution of BCI technology to prevent unethical augmentation. In sum, when guided by ethical principles, BCI technology promotes accessibility, inclusivity, and well-being for individuals with disabilities.
