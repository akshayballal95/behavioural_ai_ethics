Examples of the directionality heuristic outside of BCI are not hard to find. Functional MRI used to identify psychological traits (‘brainotyping’) is an example.[7] As a gleaning neurotechnology, fMRI technology can be seen to raise questions about privacy. What is the nature of the information gathered by means of this technology? Who controls or owns this information? How can it be legitimately used? What counts as a violation or transgression relative to this information?

The question – is it a tool or is it myself? – takes on an ethical valence when researchers ask whether BCI users will become “cyborgs.” [[ethical aspects of brain computer interfaces.pdf]]
