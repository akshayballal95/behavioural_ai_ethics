Brain Machine Interfaces is the same as Brain Computer Interfaces

Crucial elements are the ability of a BCI to 
1. Detect brain activity directly
2. Provide Feedback in real-time or near-time
3. Classify brain activity
4. Provide Feedback to the user 

#### Three main approaches

1. Non Invasive Recording  - Electroencephalogram, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and near-infrared spectroscopy
2. Invasive - Electrocorticography - Surface of the cortex
3. From within the cortex


#### Contraptions
1. VR Headsets
2.
