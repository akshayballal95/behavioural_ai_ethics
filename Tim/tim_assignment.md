## **Empirical Premise**
Brain-computer interfacing will induce widespread plastic changes in the brain which should be monitored
## **Ethical / Normative Premise**
The change in personality that follows from a BCI should not impact the access to BCI, but the effects on the personality should be understood and disclosed to the person that will be part of the BCI.
## **Conclusion**
If we want BCI systems to be responsibly used, it is necessary to research and understand the influences that it has on the behavior and character of the person whose brain will be interacted with.

Technology is inherently altering our brain as it is a extension of our actions. 

The effect of the utility increases over the extent to which the technology integrates with our brain. A hammer, as an elemental example, is a static prosthetic that in comparison to our car or social media identity does not merge with our identity as human being. We base part of our social relationships through our technical tools, where the technology influences our character and behavior.
