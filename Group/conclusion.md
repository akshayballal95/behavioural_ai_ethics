## Conclusion on AI / data privacy (emperical / summarization) - Akshay

Through the previous sections we presented various implications of using AI powered BCI technology. We found that BCI can prove extremely useful for people with disabilities to be inclusive in the society. BCI can mitigate their disabilities and restore their capability to hear, see, learn and move like anyone else. But we also found some problems attached to the use of this revolutionary technology. There are risks related to the physical and mental safety of the user and also the privacy risks that the users are exposed to. In relation to the safety of the users, BCI can cause long term effects to the functioning of the brain and the users may not be communicated about this leading to complications. Moreover, since BCI is a digital technology, it comes with all the risks related to privacy and interferences. Just like how a computer could be hacked and interfered with, BCI devices can also be vulnerable to such attacks. This can expose the user to risks like breach of data, loss of control to their device and more. This shows that BCI has many positive applications but when developing BCI technology we need to keep in mind the negative implications and mitigate these risks through design and research. 

## General conclusion positive and negative side to BCI (ethical & moral implications) - Tim


## Recommmendation for BCI research - Sven
 1. BCI has to be inclusive
 2. Should not be augmented
 3. There should an attempt to understand the underlying mechanisms that could change character and behavior
