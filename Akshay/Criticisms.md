Examples of the directionality heuristic outside of BCI are not hard to find. Functional MRI used to identify psychological traits (‘brainotyping’) is an example.[7] As a gleaning neurotechnology, fMRI technology can be seen to raise questions about privacy. What is the nature of the information gathered by means of this technology? Who controls or owns this information? How can it be legitimately used? What counts as a violation or transgression relative to this information?

The question – is it a tool or is it myself? – takes on an ethical valence when researchers ask whether BCI users will become “cyborgs.” [[ethical aspects of brain computer interfaces.pdf]]
