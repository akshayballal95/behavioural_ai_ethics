## General conclusion positive and negative side to BCI (ethical & moral implications) - Tim

## Recommmendation for BCI research - Sven
 The implications for researchers in the BCI field is that there are definitely risks and downsides involved, but these can be reduced as much as possible to reach a state where the benefits outweigh the risks and impact of this risk. The benefits from BCI have a positive influence on the wellbeing of individuals through accessibility and inclusivity for example. The implications of a privacy breach are still very significant, however, with careful and considerate engineering this risk can be reduced. Researchers should also consider the application for the BCI, where a controlled environment sets the stage for the best possible risk mitigation, exposure to the current outside environment will inherently increase the risk on concerns such as privacy. It is of utmost importance to keep this risks down with as much effort as possible to make sure the risks do not outweigh the benefits. Because these benefits will still exist also when the risks are too high, this should be a good motivation to mitigate the risks as there is a lot to gain. 

 Furthermore, The people involved with BCI research should make an effort to understand the underlying mechanisms that could change character and behavior. 
 
 
 
 1. BCI has to be included
 2. Should not be augmented
 3. There should an attempt to understand the underlying mechanisms that could change character and behavior
