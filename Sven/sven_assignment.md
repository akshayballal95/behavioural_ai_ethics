# Present the argument

In this section it will become clear why BCI poses a threat to human rights. I will discuss the ethical implication of external interference and present some counterarguments. I will explain why this counterarguments and the current strategy does not suffice. 


### Introduce the argument
A study showed that one of the concerns of the general public regarding the BCI is related to privacy [Jebari 2012]. Subjects state that it is required to have strict legislation in order to prevent sensitive information from landing in the wrong hands. But is this legislation a solution to the privacy problem? I argue that the use of wireless communication in BCI exposes its user to risk of interference. 


### Provide context and background information regarding the argument
Informational privacy is of concern regarding BCI because of the nature of the data. This data may contain unexpressed thoughts, personality characteristics and emotions among others. With this data being so sensitive it is of utmost importance that this data is handled very carefully. With this in mind, a wireless communication system is prone to external interference like electromagnetic interference or even deliberate hacking attempts. 
 


### Clearly state the premises and conclusion of the argument.
According to article 12 in the UHDR, no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy. Using BCI with wireless communication will violate the human rights. 



# Evaluating the argument
### Assess the truth and validity of the premises in the argument.
Since wireless communication is prone to external interference the risk of a data leak is significant. The ethical implication of interference in the form of deliberate hacking, might be that there are unknown third parties who are able to access your thoughts. This directly violates the 12th article in the UHDR. Since the document for UHDR is widely adopted as valid I will consider this a valid premise as well. 


### Discuss the logical structure of the argument.
There is a conditional relationship between the premises. If there is a risk of interference, then there are potential privacy concerns. I conclude my statement by connecting the two premises. 

### For ethical/normative premises, delve into the interpretation of the premise and provide additional arguments to support its strength and generality.
The premise includes a stress on the importance of privacy for humans. This right is not te be violated without just cause. This premise is not just a philosophical concept but it is incorporated into legal documents such as the UHDR and the ECHR. The recognition of this right into law also implies its importance. 

In a way, the interference with privacy can be connected with broader ethical principles such as autonomy and dignity. Since they are not able to have their own thoughts without worrying they will be leaked to any other instance or entity for example. 


### Cite and discuss additional sources that comment on this or related issues, adding to the analysis.
Glannon also discussed the undermining of autonomy by interference on wireless BCI [Glannon 2013]


# Adressing Counterarguments
### Anticipate potential objections and counterarguments to your position.
One of the objections which could be argued is that wireless protocols are being developed to be more resilient against external interference. There is a lot of development in cybersecurity in general which should prevent any data leaks. 


### Provide responses or counterarguments to these objections.
On the other side there is also a lot of development going into avoiding these security measures. People will always find ways to get to this data and as discussed earlier this is harmful to the BCI subject in question. 



### Ensure a fair representation of alternative viewpoints.


### Highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these counterarguments.


# Conslusion

### Summarize the key points of your discussion.


### Reiterate your main argument and its implications.


### Explain the overall significance or "upshot" of your analysis.

### Discuss whether the existing ethics literature needs revision or reconsideration based on your evaluation.
