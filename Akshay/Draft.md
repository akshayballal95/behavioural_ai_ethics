### Are We Cyborgs Yet

In this section we are going to see why it is important for us as humans to develop AI technologies that can enable Brain Computer Interfaces to cater to individuals with disabilities. I argue that despite some of the criticisms related to loss of personhood the social stigma around use of BCI, it is ethically very important to continue developing this technology. We will also dive more into these criticisms and counterarguments and explain why these criticisms should not impede the development of BCI technology. They only serve as design challenges that can be overcome with fore thought and engineering. We will also see how we can use the Capability Approach Framework (Ananya Sen) to reinforce our argument. 

Accessibility is viewed as one of the most important aspects of any designs these days. From public infrastructures like museums, offices etc to digital interfaces like apps and websites, accessibility is at the core of design principles. Catering to people with disabilities has always been a challenge across different fields. 

Similar to accessibility, inclusivity is equally important. In a way inclusivity and accessibility are related. For a system to be inclusive, it has to be first accessible for all. Disability inclusion means that individuals with disabilities have the opportunity to participate in every aspect of life to the fullest extent possible. These opportunities include participation in education, employment, public health programs, community living and service learning. 

But it can be seen that even the most accessible and inclusive systems may not be able to integrate people with disabilities to the complete extent as possible. People with disabilities can be catered to in two different ways. 

1. Changing the environment around them, so as to accommodate and compensate for the disability
2. Reducing the extent of their disability so that they can interact with the environment in the same way that people without disabilities do. 

Several design frameworks exist to address the former. These include ramps, text to speech, special schools etc. But we can argue that even though these solution make the system more inclusive, there is more to be desired. Given a choice to reduce the disability so that these changes in the environment can be avoided, that would be the best option. 

Brain Computer Interfaces have the potential to use Artificial intelligence to let people perform actions that they otherwise wouldn't given their disability. There have been several advancement in BCI technologies that have shown promising breakthroughs in Thought to Speech and Thought to Action. This shows that BCI has the power to reduce or in some cases completely eliminate the disability of a person.  Thus it is safe to argue that using Artificial Intelligence to increase the capabilities of Brain Computer Interfaces leads to higher accessibility and inclusivity for people with disabilities. 

Capability Approach is an ethical framework that claims that the freedom to achieve well-being is of primary moral importance and well-being should be understood in terms of people's capabilities and functioning. _Functionings_ represent parts of the state of a person–in particular the various things that he or she manages to do or be in leading a life. The _capability_ of a person reflects the alternative combinations of functionings the person can achieve, and from which he or she can choose one collection.

Some functionings are very elementary, such as being adequately nourished, being in good health, etc., and these may be strongly valued by all, for obvious reasons. Others may be more complex, but still widely valued, such as achieving self‐respect or being socially integrated.

In view of the capability approach we can see that BCIs act as "Enablers". They enable the well-being of people with disabilities to get back an extent of their functionings so that they are made capable to achieve what they want. 

There are some criticisms and counterarguments that are have been and could be raised against the BCI technologies acting as "Enablers" for people with disability. 

1. Does this technology make people less human. The term "Cyborgization" comes into mind. 
2. Using technology to enable critical functionings and capabilities like crossing a road or driving a vehicle can have unintended consequences if the technology fails. 
3. Long term effects of using BCI on the brain and body. 

The first criticism against the technology has been raised a lot but it has not been shown clearly what cyborgization clearly is. Humans have always used technology to increase their capabilities and add more functionings. For example, humans on their own cannot move at a speed more than roughly 30 kms/hr. When a human integrates himself with an automobile he can easily reach over 100 kms/hr without tiring himself/herself. Similarly, cochlear implants are "enablers" for people who are profoundly deaf and spectacles for people with vision problems. We have also implanted ourselves with pacemakers and bone replacements to restore our critical body functionings. I would argue that cyborgization has been taking place for a long time and BCIs are a big step towards this. But it cannot be shown that cyborgization is bad because if cyborgization can act as an "Enabler" in the capability approach then it is good. 

The second criticism is something that can really put a halt on development on BCI technology because a couple of mishaps due to BCI can shed bad light. But this can be viewed as an engineering and risk management problem. BCI technology developers have to make sure that there are enough redundancies and fallbacks in case BCIs are used to restore functionings that are used for critical capabilities like driving, crossing a road etc. Risk mitigation is of key importance. It is quite similar to other critical technologies that have been developed before like airplanes where a small mishap could lead to a catastrophe. But because we know that there is a large risk, certification bodies and engineers have to make the qualification and testing very stringent. Today, because of strict certification and high quality assurance aircrafts are one of the safest modes of transports.
