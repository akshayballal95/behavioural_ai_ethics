Ethical Aspects of AI driven Brain Computer Interfaces


## Argument 1

#### **Empirical Premise**

AI technology can enhance brain-computer interfaces, enabling individuals with disabilities to communicate and control devices more effectively.

#### **Ethical / Normative Premise**

Inclusivity and accessibility are ethical imperatives, and technology should be designed to empower and improve the quality of life for all individuals, including those with disabilities.

#### **Conclusion**

Despite concerns related to loss of personhood and the stigma attached to BCI technology ,it is necessary to develop AI technologies that can improve brain-computer interfaces because this aligns with ethical principles of inclusivity and accessibility, enabling a better quality of life for individuals with disabilities.

## **Empirical Premise**

BCI data is sensitive and can reveal intimate details about a person's cognitive and emotional state.

## **Ethical / Normative Premise**

Privacy is a fundamental ethical value, and individuals have a right to control the access and use of their personal data, including EEG data.

## **Conclusion**

Ethical considerations demand that AI-driven EEG data-based applications prioritize data privacy, consent, and security to ensure that individuals' sensitive information is protected and used responsibly.

## **Empirical Premise**
Brain-computer interfacing will induce widespread plastic changes in the brain which should be monitored
## **Ethical / Normative Premise**
The change in personality that follows from a BCI should not impact the access to BCI, but the effects on the personality should be understood and disclosed to the person that will be part of the BCI.
## **Conclusion**
If we want BCI systems to be responsibly used, it is necessary to research and understand the influences that it has on the behavior and character of the person whose brain will be interacted with.

## **Empirical Premise**

The deployment of AI-driven EEG data-based applications in legal contexts, such as lie detection or brain fingerprinting, raises ethical concerns about the potential for misuse and infringements on individuals' rights.
## **Ethical / Normative Premise**

Ethical principles of due process and the presumption of innocence should be upheld, and any use of AI in legal settings should be subject to strict oversight and regulation.

## **Conclusion**

The ethical use of AI-driven EEG data-based applications in legal contexts should be governed by robust regulations and oversight mechanisms to ensure fair and just outcomes and protect individuals' rights.
