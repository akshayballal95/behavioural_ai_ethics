### What is BCI

### VR Headsets
### How AI is helping BCI


use of BCI is the greatest ethical challenge that neuroscience faces today. 


### Issues
1. User Safety and risk-benefit analysis
	- Brain's plasticity is still-developing children and even in adults could bring about unknown negative side-effects of BCI use.
	- A sudden lack of functionality would impact the user directly and immediately. BCI operated wheel chair could fail in the middle of the street while crossing
2. Humanity and Personhood
	- Whether BCI users will become "cyborgs" - an integrated man-machine system
	- But authors argue that we have been routinely using technology to change the body in the form of artificial devices replacing broken parts. (Bone implants, pacemakers)
	- Risk of losing what makes us human. 
	- Evolving into "*Homo Sapiens Technologicus*"
	- May change our social identity, body schema, or individual psychological aspects
3. Stigma and Normality
	- If an individual does not see him or herself as disabled, is a BCI that is meant to be assistive technology actually an enhancement?
